#Oblate WordPress Theme

## Personal WordPress theme for blogging

I like simple, clean, minimalist blogs. I don't like sidebars, ads, widgets, plugins, or anything else on my blog - because if you're here, you're here for the content. Outside of a simple header with links to my GitHub, Twitter, and RSS feeds, the site consists only of articles.

## External resources

* Browser consistency with [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) 
* Syntax highlighting with [Prism](http://prismjs.com/)
* Custom fonts with [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)
* Task running with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* No jQuery or JavaScript.

## Directory Structure

* Theme files are all located in **wp-content/themes/oblate**
* Source files are located in **grunt** folder
* Running `gulp` command applies a Sass watch to source files and compiles to theme files
